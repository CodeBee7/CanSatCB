# CanSatCB
Bees, though small in stature, hold an outsized role in both the natural world and human society. These insects, often underestimated, are crucial to the functioning of ecosystems, food production, and various aspects of our daily lives.
The landmark 2019 report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) emphasises: “Sacred passages about bees in all the worlds’ major religions highlight their significance to human societies over millennia.”
 Nonetheless, the global bee population is under threat due to habitat loss, pesticide exposure, diseases, and climate change. Our CanSat will be designed in order to raise awareness about our little marvels in order to protect them at all costs.
 Our aim is to design and build a CanSat to be launched and deployed from a rocket at an altitude of up to 2500 metres. After deployment from the rocket, CanSat should fall no faster than 11 metres per second. After take-off, during descent and after landing, CanSat has the task of measuring, saving on SD/microSD card and sending to the ground station (at least once per second and with the use of radio module) the following telemetry data:
● ambient air temperature (outside the satellite housing),
● atmospheric pressure
During falling, the satellite will investigate NO₂ concentration at an altitude of not more than 1000 m (measured with an altitude sensor). NO₂  concentration will be sent to the ground station, where the real-time graph of this variable will be drawn.
Then, after landing it is to continue carrying out the primary mission for as long as it can or until its recovery. We will also use a GPS module that will give us the CanSat geographic coordinates after landing to help the arrangers find it.
